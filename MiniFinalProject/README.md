## Description
This Mini Final Project incorporates the knowledge and understanding of chapter 11 of the OSC textbook by implementing 3 disk-scheduling algorithms;
1. FCFS
2. SCAN
3. C-SCAN

## How to Use
The name of the input must be ``` input.txt ``` . After every test case, please remove the previously used ```input.txt``` file or replace the contents with the new test case.

use the given make file to run the desired main.c file, this will clean the directory of object files created and the output.txt file will be removed:

```bash
make all
```
you can clean the directory as well using:
```bash
make clean
```
## Extra
I ran the make file on the Virtual machine and it compiled and wrote to the output file correctly, if any issues please contact me at chrisaug@my.yorku.ca
